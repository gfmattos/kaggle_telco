# **Focused customer retention programs**

## *Context*
"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]

## *Content*

Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## *Inspiration*
To explore this type of models and learn more about the subject.
